# I think it uses functions but I'm curious to find out how to differentiate it from procedural programming.

# One difference I have seen is that here we use pure functions which are functions that only generate output based on their input and do nothing else.

# Pure functions do not depend on global variables

# Remember output is determined by input

# Recursion comes at play in this paradigm It is a function that calls itself. It always has a base call(where it will terminate) and the recursive call where the function is called + the modifcation
