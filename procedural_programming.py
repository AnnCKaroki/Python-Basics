# Based on the concept of procedures

# It allows for a piece of code to be rerun multiple times

# Implemented as functions in python

# Makes sense when problems naturally break down into steps

# I think procedural programming is just about laying out the steps that will be carried by use of functions. Whereby you define a function with its parameters and specific things that should happen and then call the function as many times as you want.
